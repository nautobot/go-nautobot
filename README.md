# go-nautobot

`nautobot` package provides the Go Bindings to interact with [Nautobot Source of Truth](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API, starting from version 1.3.2.

This package is fully automated, and every release it's triggered automatically from the Nautobot release pipeline for every new version released. So, there is direct mapping between a tag in this package and the same Nautobot tag.

It uses `oapi-codegen` and it takes the `swagger.yaml` generated by Nautobot service, with `api_version=1.3` that implements OpenAPI 3.0.

## Release Versioning

`go-nautobot` uses semantic versioning with a dependency on the Nautobot minor version used to generate the bindings.

The minor version in `go-nautobot` will always match the minor version from Nautobot, but the patch version will evolve independently.

For example, a fictitious release process would be:

| Nautobot | go-nautobot            |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| 5.1.0    | 5.1.0                  |
| 5.1.1    | 5.1.1                  |
| 5.1.1    | 5.1.2 (some local fix) |
| 5.1.2    | 5.1.3                  |

This way the project versioning will keep relationship with the original minor Nautobot version while enabling its own release lifecycle.

## How to use `nautobot` package

### Go Get Nautobot package

Simply point your get of the `nautobot` package to the version you require, in the example version `1.3.2`:

```bash
$ go get github.com/nautobot/go-nautobot/pkg/nautobot@v1.3.2
```

### Go main example

This is example is also available in `example/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	nb "github.com/nautobot/go-nautobot/pkg/nautobot"
)

func check(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func main() {
	token, err := nb.NewSecurityProviderNautobotToken("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
	check(err)

	c, err := nb.NewClientWithResponses(
		"https://demo.nautobot.com/api/",
		nb.WithRequestEditorFn(token.Intercept),
	)
	check(err)

	ctx := context.Background()

	resp, err := c.DcimManufacturersListWithResponse(ctx, &nb.DcimManufacturersListParams{})
	check(err)

	fmt.Printf("%v", string(resp.Body))

}

```

### How to use while being a private repository

```bash
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/nautobot/go-nautobot

vi ~/.gitconfig
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
	insteadOf = https://github.com/
```

## Local Development

### Run it locally

```
docker-compose --project-name go_nautobot -f development/docker-compose.yml --env-file development/local_dev.env up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

Hint: If you get a build fail during testing, check that you are not limiting container memory to 2GB. Upgrade to 4GB.

### Trigger the build manually

The release process can be triggered manually from GitHub Actions CLI:

```
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=1.3.2
```

- [] Notify in slack for every release or failure
- [] Add a step in Nautobot, at the end of OSRB
