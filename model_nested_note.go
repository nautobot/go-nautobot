// This base serializer implements common fields and logic for all ModelSerializers.  Namely, it:  - defines the `display` field which exposes a human friendly value for the given object. - ensures that `id` field is always present on the serializer as well. - ensures that `created` and `last_updated` fields are always present if applicable to this model and serializer. - ensures that `object_type` field is always present on the serializer which represents the content-type of this   serializer's associated model (e.g. \"dcim.device\"). This is required as the OpenAPI schema, using the   PolymorphicProxySerializer class defined below, relies upon this field as a way to identify to the client   which of several possible serializers are in use for a given attribute. - supports `?depth` query parameter. It is passed in as `nested_depth` to the `build_nested_field()` function   to enable the dynamic generation of nested serializers.
type NestedNote struct {
	Id string `json:"id"`
	ObjectType string `json:"object_type"`
	Url string `json:"url"`
}
